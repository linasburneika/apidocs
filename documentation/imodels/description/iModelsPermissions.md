### Authorization

User must have `{permission}` permission assigned at the iModel level and at least `imodels_webview` permission assigned at the iTwin level. If permissions at the iModel level are not configured, then user must have `{permission}` permission assigned at the iTwin level.

Alternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given iTwin the iModel belongs to.

An Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.
